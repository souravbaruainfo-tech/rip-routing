# rip-routing
Packet Tracer project demonstrating RIP dynamic routing configuration.
RIP Routing â€“ Dynamic Network Topology
This project demonstrates the implementation of Routing Information Protocol (RIP v2) in a multi-router environment using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network topology is designed to showcase dynamic route advertisement, route convergence, and end-to-end connectivity in an enterprise-style setup.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
Implements RIP v2 for classless, dynamic routing.

Simulates multi-network environments with multiple routers.

Configures IP addressing, subnetting, and route verification.

Demonstrates automatic route propagation and hop count metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Files Included
RIP Routing.pkt â€“ Complete Cisco Packet Tracer topology with configured routers.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run
Open RIP Routing.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or later).

Use CLI commands to inspect routing tables (show ip route) and test connectivity (ping, tracert).

Modify or expand the network to experiment with RIP scaling.

ðŸ”¹ Learning Objectives
Understand dynamic routing protocols in a simulated environment.

Learn RIP v2 configuration commands and troubleshooting steps.

Gain hands-on experience with route updates and convergence.
